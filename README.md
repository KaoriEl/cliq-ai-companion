## Overview

Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code are powerful tools, but using them inside an IDE often means switching between terminal, editor, and project files.

Cliq removes that friction. It runs agents inside the JetBrains terminal, shares active workspace context, and turns AI-generated edits into real IDE diffs you can inspect, modify, accept, or reject.

Cliq does not replace your agent or bundle a model. It adds the missing IDE integration layer.

---

## Key Features

- **One-click agent launcher**  
  Start Claude, Gemini, Qwen from the tool window, toolbar, Tools menu, or `Ctrl+Alt+Q`.

- **Native IDE diff reviews**  
  AI changes open as side-by-side diffs with syntax highlighting, editable proposals, and per-hunk actions.

- **Live workspace context sync**  
  Shares active files, cursor position, selection, and recent files with the running agent.

- **Built-in MCP server**  
  Local loopback MCP server with secure token-based access.

- **Files Context panel**  
  Pin files, track recently opened files, and send `@file` references directly to the terminal.

- **Prompt composer**  
  Build prompts with optional file context and send instantly to the active terminal session.

- **Auto-apply mode**  
  Trusted autonomous runs can write changes directly without review.

- **No telemetry**  
  No analytics, no external background requests, local-only communication.
